Webswing is packaged and distributed as a fully working platform with some examples for your convenience, so no complicated installation is needed. Just unpack the distribution zip file and you are good to go. The only prerequisite is to have a supported version of Java installed. 

Supported Java versions for starting server are

* Oracle Java 1.8.0_25+

---

## Starting on Windows 

If you are using the Windows operating system, you can use the `webswing.bat` script, which executes the following command: 

```
java -jar webswing-server.war -j jetty.properties
``` 

> Note: Make sure `java` is pointing to a supported java version by running `java -version` from your commandline.  

---

## Starting on Linux 

Starting Webswing on a Linux desktop (within XServer) session is as simple as running the above command--the same as on Windows.

In most cases however, the Linux server is a headless box. In these cases you would get an error when running the above command, because the Swing framework requires a graphical environment. To overcome this, we can use X virtual frame buffer (`Xvfb`) to satisfy these dependencies. 

Please install the following Linux packages to satisfy all Swing framework dependencies (names are from Ubuntu repositories - use relevant counterparts for your distribution):

* **xvfb**
* **libxext6**
* **libxi6**
* **libxtst6**
* **libxrender1**


The Webswing distribution contains a convenience Linux startup script - `webswing.sh`, which uses default startup settings. 

```shell
export HOME=<webswing.sh location>
export OPTS="-h 0.0.0.0 -j $HOME/jetty.properties -u $HOME/user.properties -c $HOME/webswing.config"
export JAVA_HOME=$JAVA_HOME
export JAVA_OPTS="-Xmx128M" 
```

These may be overridden by setting the following environment variables: 

* WEBSWING_HOME
* WEBSWING_OPTS
* WEBSWING_JAVA_HOME
* WEBSWING_JAVA_OPTS
* WEBSWING_LOG_FILE
* WEBSWING_PID_FILE

for example: 
```shell
WEBSWING_HOME=/home/webswing WEBSWING_JAVA_HOME=/var/share/jdk8 ./webswing.sh start
```

When started, this script will create two additional files in the `HOME` folder (by default).

* `webswing.pid` storing the PID of current Webswing process
* `webswing.out` standard output and error is redirected to this file.

When running the script you have following options:

```
Usage: webswing.sh {run|start|stop|restart|status}
``` 

Command 	        | Description
--------------------| ------------
webswing.sh run        | This command can be used to start Webswing if you are inside X session. This will block the terminal until server stops. 
webswing.sh start      | Start Webswing as daemon in new Xvfb session using the `xvfb-run` command
webswing.sh stop       | Stops running Webswing server
webswing.sh restart    | Stops and starts Webswing server
webswing.sh status     | Checks if Webswing server is running.

## Important files

Webswing distribution contains several files, but only three of them are necessary to run Webswing.

![files.png](../img/files.png)

1. `webswing-server.war` file is the main executable file. This file is a regular java web application archive with embedded jetty server.

2. `webswing.config` file contains the configuration of swing applications. Swing application's class-path, main class, arguments and permissions are described in this file. See more details in "Application setup" section.

3. (optional)`jetty.properties` is a convenient option of configuring the built-in jetty server. Each setting can be overridden with command-line option. For more details refer to [Server start-up parameters](../setup) section

**Webswing generates following output files:**

`tmp` folder is created for extracting client libraries and temporary files generated by application print or file download functionality. Path for this temporary folder can be changed by defining command-line option `-t <path>` . By default `tmp` folder contents are wiped when Webswing starts. If `-d true` is set, a time-stamped folder inside `tmp` is created every time Webswing server is started.

`webswing.log` file for storing Webswing server and swing application instance logs.
